1. Get the Data:

Read the data values from a file (like a CSV) or a list.
2. Calculate the Mean (Average):

Add up all the data values.
Divide the sum by the total number of values.
3. Calculate the Median (Middle Value):

Sort the data values from smallest to largest.
If there's an odd number of values, the median is the middle value.
If there's an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.
4. Calculate the Mode (Most Frequent Value):

Create a dictionary (like a table) to store each value and how many times it appears.
Go through each data value:
If the value is already in the dictionary, increase its count.
If not, add the value to the dictionary with a count of 1.
Find the value(s) with the highest count in the dictionary â€“ that's the mode.
5. Show the Results:

Print or display the calculated mean, median, and mode.
In simpler terms:

Mean: Like finding the average score in a class.
Median: The middle value when you line up all the values.
Mode: The value that appears most often.
